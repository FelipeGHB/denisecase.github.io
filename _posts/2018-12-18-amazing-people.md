<p>I've been fortunate throughout my career to get to work on fascinating projects with outstanding people. Academia is unusual in that many wonderful teammates will only stay for a short while before they move on to make the world a better place with some other team.</p>
<p>I'd like to offer a special thank you to recent graduates,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shirisha-reddy-rapole-78ab93150/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shirisha Reddy Rapole</a>&nbsp;(pictured) and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/santhosh-bonala-245b60143/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Santhosh Bonala</a>. They shared their initiative and expertise - and worked tirelessly with good humor to help get everyone over each academic challenge we presented. Their soft skills and technical abilities will make them valuable assets where ever they land.</p>
<p>Our office assistants, Ashwith Gundu,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kishan-ks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kishan Kalburgi Srinivas</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vineethagarwal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vineeth Agarwal</a>, chosen for their initiative, resourcefulness, efficiency, broad capabilities, and positive attitudes, have been outstanding.</p>
<p>In addition, it's been a privilege to work with recent graduate&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/durga-charan-potukuru-179051ab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Durga Charan Potukuru</a>&nbsp;and three continuing students, Manogna Sivangula,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sai-sirisha-devineni-86a60251/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sai Sirisha Devineni</a>, and<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shivani-busireddy-728777158/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;Shivani Busireddy</a>. We're happy they'll remain part of our team while they continue their studies.</p>
<p>To all the amazing men and women I've had the good fortune to work with, if you are graduating this semester, we wish you the very best. It's a wonderful feeling knowing you'll be out there continuing to work your magic across the world. Keep up the good work - and stay in touch!</p>
