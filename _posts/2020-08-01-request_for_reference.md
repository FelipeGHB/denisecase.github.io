Job searches continue! If you would like me to act as a verbal reference and share my recommendations, please:

* Send me an email with your full name and ' - Reference information' as the subject. 
* Attach your resume or cv.
* Attach your completed FERPA form.
* Make sure your FERPA form has all the boxes checked that you allow me to discuss.
* Make sure your FERPA form has the last box checked that allows me to provide a verbal reference.
* Include any other highlights, bragging rights, work and/or project experience, links to your GitHub profile, LinkedIn profile, volunteer efforts, 
good grades, and other information that may be helpful in the body of the email.
* Include the list of current (and previous) courses taken with me - and ensure the appropriate academic records boxes are checked - 
so that I can share information about your grades and attendance when called. 

Thank you - best wishes on your job search!
