<p>Lohitha is one of our exceptional graduate assistants earning her&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nwmissouri.edu/csis/msacs/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Masters in Applied Computer Science</a>&nbsp;and will be graduating this semester. She is a natural ambassador for the field and an outstanding teaching assistant. Her work experience includes 44-563 Developing Web Apps and Services and 44-517 Big Data.</p>
<blockquote><em>"Lohitha Bhethalam and I had a great time at the 2019 My Success Event in St. Joseph.&nbsp;We engaged with over one hundred sophomores in regional high schools speaking with them about careers in technology. She is an excellent representative of our field and was very influential with the students."</em></blockquote>
