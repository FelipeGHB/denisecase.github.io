Some key conferences related to women in computer science:

*   [Grace Hopper](http://gracehopper.org/) - mid-October, Wed-Fri

    * The Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing is the World's Largest Gathering of Women Technologists, produced by the Anita Borg Institute and presented in partnership with ACM. 
     
*   [MINK WIC](http://minkcwic.hosting.acm.org) - mid-October, Fri-Sat (after Grace Hopper)

    * [MINK-WIC 2015 Fri-Sat Oct 15-16](http://minkcwic.hosting.acm.org/)  
    * The Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, and Kansas Women in Computing (MINK WIC) conference is a regional meeting modeled after the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing. It brings together students, faculty, and technology leaders from the four state area to discuss the role of women in today’s computing and technology fields. The goal is to provide an opportunity for young women to explore opportunities in computing, to network with other women from academia, industry, and government, and to create friendship among women in the region who share the same interest and passion for computing. This celebration is part of a nationwide effort to address the alarming decline of women choosing computer science professions. 


*   [ACM-W](http://women.acm.org/) - Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)'s Women in Computing supports, celebrates, and advocates internationally for the full engagement of women in all aspects of the computing field, providing a wide range of programs and services to ACM members and working in the larger community to advance the contributions of technical women.
