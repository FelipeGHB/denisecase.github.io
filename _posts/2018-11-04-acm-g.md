<p>Congratulations to the new officers of our Association for Computing Machinery - Graduate Chapter (ACM-G) at&nbsp;<a href="http://nwmissouri.edu/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Northwest Missouri State University</a>!</p>
<p>ACM-G hosts coding workshops, programming contests, coding competitions, game nights, and more. The group works with the Missouri Department of Transportation to maintain a section of highway between Maryville and St. Joseph, Missouri. The organization hosts an annual Hour of Code event to give students from other departments and the community a chance to experience the joy and power of computing.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajay-bandi-6ab7b162/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Ajay Bandi</a>&nbsp;and I are proud to be sponsors of this outstanding student organization. We will truly miss working with each and every one of the 2017-2018 officers and look forward to the promising new 2018-2019 team.</p>
